== About

yahoo-weather provides an object-oriented interface to the Yahoo! Weather XML
RSS feed detailed at http://developer.yahoo.com/weather.

People care a lot about the weather, which sometimes seems ironic given that
they can just glance out the window, but we can all understand the fascination
with details and forecasting.

Log the weather information to your database! Graph it to your heart's
content! Write a widget that emails the weather to your cell phone every five
minutes with a link to your friend's PayPal account to deposit money if the
weather's sunny and you both bet that it would be rainy. And the fun doesn't
have to stop there.

The RubyForge project page is at http://rubyforge.org/projects/yahoo-weather.
